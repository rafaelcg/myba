## 📊 Current Architecture

### Frontend Stack
```
React + Vite + TypeScript + Clerk
- HomePage.tsx - Main interface with state management
- TokenManager.tsx - Payment plans and token purchasing  
- Anonymous token system with browser fingerprinting
- Real-time token balance updates
- Success/error notifications with auto-dismiss
```

### Backend Stack
```
Node.js + Express + Stripe + OpenRouter
- server.js - Main API server with comprehensive error handling
- Webhook endpoints for Clerk and Stripe events
- Anonymous session management (in-memory)
- Token transfer system with Stripe integration
- Health monitoring with session counts
```

### Data Storage
```
Stripe Customer Metadata (Primary)
├── tokens: "15"              // Total available tokens
├── tokens_used: "3"          // Consumed tokens
├── tokens_purchased: "10"    // Purchased tokens
├── tokens_transferred: "2"   // Transferred from anonymous
├── last_purchase: "2025-08-07"
└── transfer_date: "2025-08-07"

In-Memory Storage (Cache)
├── userTokens Map           // Authenticated users
└── anonymousSessions Map    // Anonymous sessions
```

## 🛠️ Environment Configuration

### Required Environment Variables
```bash
# Authentication
CLERK_SECRET_KEY=sk_test_...
CLERK_WEBHOOK_SECRET=whsec_JZ2Y...

# Payments  
STRIPE_SECRET_KEY=sk_test_...
STRIPE_WEBHOOK_SECRET=whsec_OxpU...

# AI Service
OPENAI_API_KEY=sk-or-v1-...  # OpenRouter API key
```

### Active Webhook URLs
- **Clerk:** `http://152.42.141.162/myba/api/webhook/clerk`
- **Stripe:** `http://152.42.141.162/myba/api/webhook/stripe`

## 🔄 Key Workflows

### Anonymous to Authenticated Flow
1. User visits → Gets 3 anonymous tokens (fingerprint-based)
2. Uses tokens for AI generation → Consumption tracked locally + server
3. Signs up → Automatic transfer of remaining anonymous tokens
4. Welcome bonus: 6 base tokens + transferred tokens
5. Success notification with token count

### Payment Flow 
1. User selects plan → Stripe checkout session created
2. Payment completed → Stripe webhook processes payment
3. Tokens added to customer metadata → Local cache updated  
4. User redirected with success URL → Frontend shows celebration
5. Token balance refreshed automatically (with retry logic)

### AI Generation Flow
1. Input validation → Token availability check
2. Provider selection (MyBA AI / User API / Mock)
3. Token consumption (if using MyBA AI)
4. API call to OpenRouter → Response processing
5. Results display with provider attribution

## 🔧 Maintenance & Operations

### Server Management
```bash
# Check health
curl http://152.42.141.162:3001/api/health

# View logs  
tail -f /var/www/html/myba/api.log

# Restart server
./deploy-live.sh

# Stop server
kill $(cat api.pid)
```

### Monitoring Endpoints
- **Health Check:** `/api/health` - System status + metrics
- **Plans:** `/api/plans` - Pricing configuration
- **User Tokens:** `/api/user-tokens/:userId` - Token balance

### Key Log Patterns
```bash
# Webhook processing
📥 [webhook_id] Webhook received
✅ [webhook_id] Processed successfully in Xms

# Token transfers  
🔄 [transfer_id] Transferring X tokens
✅ [transfer_id] Successfully transferred

# Payment processing
💰 [webhook_id] Payment completed! User X purchased Y tokens
🎫 [webhook_id] Successfully added Y tokens
```
